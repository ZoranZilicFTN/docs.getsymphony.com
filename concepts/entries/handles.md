#### Overview

Handles are strings that are generated for all Symphony pages, and by certain <a rel="concept">field types</a> to provide sanitized, URL-friendly equivalents for the values they store. For example, a text input with the value “Symphony, it’s for Ninjas” would have the following handle autogenerated for it: `symphony-its-for-ninjas`. Handles are often used for filtering data sources and populating data source output parameters.

Of the core field types, <a rel="concept" href="field-types#text-input">Text Input</a>, <a rel="concept" href="field-types#tag-list">Tag List</a>, <a rel="concept" href="field-types#select-box">Select Box</a>, and <a rel="concept" href="field-types#select-box-link">Select Box Link</a> provide handles for their values.

#### Usage

Handles are autogenerated for pages and for supported fields whenever the value of the field changes.

When using a handle-enabled field to <a rel="concept" href="data-source-filters">filter a data source</a> or populate a <a rel="concept" href="data-source-output-parameters">data source output parameter</a>, the handle will be used in place of the actual value. Fields that create relationships between sections, like Select Box Link, are an exception to this rule. The <a rel="concept" href="system-ids">system ID</a> of the related entry will be used instead.
