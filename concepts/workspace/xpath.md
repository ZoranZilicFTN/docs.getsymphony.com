#### Overview

XPath is a syntax used within <a rel="concept">XSLT</a> to select nodes in an <a rel="concept">XML</a> document. XPath provides an added level of functionality in Symphony’s templating layer, enabling the use of complex matching and filtering patterns, and even basic computations and other functions. A Symphony project can thus keep purely presentational operations out of the data layer and in the templating layer.

#### Usage

XPath is used in Symphony in the context of its XSLT stylesheets—<a rel="concept">page templates</a> and <a rel="concept">utilities</a>.

#### Details

For more details on XPath, see: <http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath>.

#### The Big Picture

XPath is a widely-adopted open standard recommended by the W3C.
