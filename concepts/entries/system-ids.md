#### Overview

System IDs are unique, auto-incrementing, numerical values that are autogenerated for all content <a rel="concept">entries</a> in a Symphony project. An entry’s system ID behaves like a hidden system field—invisible during entry creation and editing, but available to <a rel="concept">data sources</a> for <a rel="concept" href="data-source-filters">filtering</a>, sorting, and output.

#### Usage

System IDs are auto-generated upon entry creation and are not editable. 

The system ID field is available to data sources for filtering, sorting, and populating <a rel="concept" href="data-source-output-parameters">output parameters</a>.

#### Details

Whenever an entry is returned by a data source, its System ID is provided as an attribute in its <a rel="concept">XML</a>.

<pre><code>
  &lt;entry id="1"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Entry fields XML --&gt;
  &lt;/entry&gt;</code></pre>
    
#### The Big Picture

<a rel="concept">Field types</a> that create relationships among entries, such as <a rel="concept" href="field-types#select-box-link">Select Box Link</a>, use system IDs to manage those associations. A section called "Children," for instance, might use a Select Box Link field called "Parent" to point to a section called "Parents." The field would store the parent's system ID, this way any of the parent entry's content could change and the link would still be maintained.
