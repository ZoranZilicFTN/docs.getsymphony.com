#### Overview

Authors are your Symphony projectâ€™s registered users. They are able to access the <a rel="concept">admin interface</a> and manage content and system settings.

There are two types of authors, each representing a distinct level of system permissions. The first type, "author," is only able to access content sections (though all authors can edit their own author entry). The second type, "developer," has access to all elements of the system.

#### Usage

Authors can be created and edited in the admin interface under `System > Authors`.

Authors lacking developer level permissions are not able to edit their advanced login settings (see below) .
