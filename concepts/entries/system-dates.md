#### Overview

System Dates are timestamps—representing the date and time of an entry's creation— that are auto-generated for all content entries in a Symphony project. System dates are not visible while creating or editing <a rel="concept">entries</a>, but are available to data sources for sorting and output.

#### Usage

System dates are auto-generated upon entry creation and are not editable.

Unlike <a rel="concept">system IDs</a>, system dates cannot be used for <a rel="concept" href="data-source-filters">data source filtering</a> and are not included in an entry's <a rel="concept">XML</a> output. They can populate <a rel="concept">data source output parameters</a>, but their primary use is in sorting a data source's result set.
