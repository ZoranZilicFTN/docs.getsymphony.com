#### Overview

XML is the markup language used by Symphony to expose content to the templating layer, where it is transformed by XSLT. Symphonyâ€™s native use of XML makes it trivially easy to work with feeds, APIs, and other XML data sets, and encourages clean, well-structured coding.

A Symphony <a rel="concept" href="pages">page</a>'s XML source is the basis for the transformations carried out by its <a rel="concept" href="page-templates">template</a> (and any included <a rel="concept">utilities</a>).

#### Usage

A page's XML source is comprised of fragments provided by attached <a rel="concept">data sources</a> and <a rel="concept">events</a>. Adding data to a page's XML source requires creating a data source to fetch it and attaching that data source to the page.

#### Details

The root element of a page's XML source is always `<data>`. Any fragments provided by data sources or events are nested within this root element.

#### The Big Picture

XML is a widely-adopted open standard recommended by the W3C.
